# C++ Testing Skill

## Overview
Master C++ testing practices using modern frameworks, including unit testing, mocking, and integration testing strategies.

## Topics Covered

### Testing Frameworks
- Google Test (gtest)
- Catch2
- Boost.Test
- doctest
- CTest integration

### Unit Testing
- Test fixture creation
- Assertions and matchers
- Parameterized tests
- Test organization
- Test discovery

### Mocking
- Google Mock basics
- Mock object creation
- Expectation setting
- Action specification
- Dependency injection for testability

### Advanced Techniques
- Property-based testing
- Fuzzing with libFuzzer
- Benchmark testing (Google Benchmark)
- Coverage analysis
- Sanitizers (ASan, UBSan, TSan)

### TDD and BDD
- Test-driven development workflow
- Behavior-driven development
- Red-green-refactor cycle
- Test naming conventions

### CI Integration
- CMake test configuration
- CI pipeline setup
- Code coverage reporting
- Test result reporting

## Prerequisites
- C++ fundamentals
- Build systems (CMake)
- Basic debugging skills

## Learning Outcomes
