# /cpp-learn

**🎓 Learning Mode Command**

Launch the C++ learning assistant to master any aspect of C++ programming from basics to advanced concepts.

## Overview

This command invokes the appropriate C++ learning agent based on your current learning focus:

| Topic | Agent Used |
|-------|------------|
| Variables, types, control flow | cpp-fundamentals-agent |
| Classes, inheritance, OOP | cpp-oop-agent |
| Pointers, RAII, smart pointers | memory-specialist |
| STL containers, algorithms | stl-master |
| Algorithms, complexity | cpp-algorithms-agent |

## Usage

```
/cpp-learn [topic]
```

## Examples

```bash
/cpp-learn                    # Start general learning session
/cpp-learn pointers           # Learn about pointers and memory
/cpp-learn oop               # Object-oriented programming
/cpp-learn stl               # Standard Template Library
/cpp-learn algorithms        # Algorithms and data structures
/cpp-learn "smart pointers"  # Specific topic
```

## What You'll Learn

- **Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, control flow, functions
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Memory Management**: Pointers, references, smart pointers, RAII
- **STL & Containers**: Collections, algorithms, iterators
- **Advanced Features**: Templates, concepts, ranges
- **Modern C++**: C++11 through C++23 features

## Teaching Approach

1. **Concept explanation** with clear examples
2. **Code demonstrations** showing best practices
3. **Common mistakes** and how to avoid them
4. **Practice suggestions** to reinforce learning
